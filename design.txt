In this drawing program, we will use several key abstractions to structure the code according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
The program will have distinct classes to handle the responsibilities of each component, and we will also create a class specifically for the "figures".

Figure: This class represents each individual figure that can be drawn in the window, such as dots, ovals, or rectangles. 
The Figure class will hold properties common to all figures, such as position (x, y), size (width, height), color, and shape type. 
It will provide methods to access these properties. This abstraction ensures that each figure is a well-defined entity with consistent attributes across the program.

Model: The Model class will be responsible for maintaining the program's internal state. 
It will hold a list of all drawn Figure objects and manage undo/redo functionality through stacks. 
The Model will allow figures to be added and removed from this list, as well as providing methods for saving and loading the drawing state. 
Adittionally, the Model will not know about the View or Controller, adhering to the separation of concerns in the MVC pattern.

View: The View class will manage the user interface and the rendering of the figures onto the window. 
It will listen for updates from the Model and display the current list of figures on the screen. 
The View will also display UI elements such as buttons (for undo, save, load, color selection) and a status label showing the current state of the program. 
While the View will be aware of the Model to fetch data for rendering, it will not interact directly with the Controller.

Controller: The Controller class will handle all user interactions, such as button clicks and mouse events. 
It will interpret these inputs and update the Model accordingly. For example, when the user clicks and drags to draw a shape, the Controller will create a new Figure object and pass it to the Model. 
The Controller will also be responsible for managing changes in the selected drawing color and shape type, as well as handling undo, redo, save, and load operations.

These four classes Figure, Model, View, and Controller will work together to implement the program. 
The Model will maintain the programâ€™s data, the View will handle presentation and user interaction, and the Controller will manage the flow of data between the two. 
This separation allows for flexibility and clarity in the code, making it easier to extend and maintain.
